1. run `./setup.sh` -> Create python3 virtual environment, install deps, and unzip database
2. run `./activate.sh` -> starts up virtual environment
3. run `source ./bin/deactivate` to pull down virtual environment, but just closing your shell works as well

* Make sure you run `./activate.sh` before coding as this will start the python3 virtual environment
